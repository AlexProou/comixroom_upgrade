                <h3>JUSTICE LEAGUE: <br> THE FLASHPOINT PARADOX</h3>
                <p>Barry Allen is the fastest man on Earth. Many years ago, his mother Nora Allen was killed by a mugger. 
                    Years later, Barry became the Flash, Central City's superhero. He soon became one of the members of the Justice League team. 
                    One day, while fighting his nemesis Professor Zoom, Barry realizes he can't get over his mother's death. 
                    He runs down the road and jumps into the Speed Force (the dimension that made him a "scarlet runner") and saves his mother from being killed.
                    Upon awakening, Barry is horrified to realize that everything has been turned upside down: his mother is alive and unharmed, his fiancée Iris has a husband and a child,
                    he doesn't have the Speed Force, the Justice League doesn't exist in this world, and the only member of the team that protects
                    world is Batman. It turns out that Barry has changed reality in a big way: in the new reality, Superman has been found and is being held in a cell, 
                    restraining his powers, Hal Jordan hasn't found the ring, Wonder Woman is at war with Aquaman, and little Bruce has been killed in Gotham City 
                    and his parents are still alive.</p>

                <p> About a team of atypical and untrustworthy superheroes, living embodiments of all beliefs of the occult. 
                    Dark magicians, monsters, demons, and ghosts will unite under the renowned psychic detective John Constantine,
                    to compete against equally powerful forces.
                    The movie starts when law-abiding citizens begin to murder people, believing their victims are demonic 
                    creatures. The Justice League gather to conclude that magic is the source of the crimes, but

                    summon Etrigan, and the two part ways.</p>

                <p> Superman has become a popular superhero in Metropolis and the world. After foiling an attempted abduction of the 
                    mayor by Intergang, he takes a piece of their technology to S.T.A.R. Labs for analysis. Following this, Superman
                    is interviewed by Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane about his family heritage and the origins of how he came to 
                    Earth. Later that night, Lois meets Clark Kent's (Superman's human identity which Lois doesn't know) adoptive 
                    parents. Because of her little knowledge about Clark's personal life, Lois leaves upset and reconsiders their 
                    relationship.
                    Clark Kent considers revealing to his lover Lois Lane his biggest secret -- that he is 
                    Superman. At the same time, the terrifying monster Doomsday arrives on Earth with incredible power and evil.
                    All of the superheroes within the Justice League are struggling to contain the monster, so Superman has to put aside 
                    his personal affairs and try to help his comrades defeat the enemy.</p>
